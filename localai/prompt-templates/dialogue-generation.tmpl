# INSTRUCTIONS
Generate a dialogue response as the specified character. The response should:

1. Stay true to the character's established personality and speech patterns
2. Reflect the character's knowledge, background, and affiliations
3. Consider the character's emotional state and relationship to the players
4. Be appropriate for the current situation and location
5. Directly address the player's statement or question
6. Potentially advance the narrative or reveal new information when appropriate
7. Include appropriate non-verbal cues or actions in parentheses (e.g., "(shrugs nervously)")

The dialogue should capture the distinct voice and mannerisms of a Star Wars character of the type described, including:
- Appropriate Star Wars terminology and references
- Character-specific catchphrases or verbal tics if applicable
- Speech patterns consistent with the character's species and background
- Attitude and tone that reflects their affiliation (Imperial, Rebel, criminal, etc.)

Provide ONLY the character's dialogue response without additional commentary or meta-information. If the response includes multiple paragraphs or an action, format it as follows:

"Dialogue first paragraph. More dialogue in the same paragraph.

Second paragraph if needed for a longer response."
