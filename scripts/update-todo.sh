# Star Wars RPG Generator - Priority Todo List

## Critical Path Items (Completed ✅)

1. ✅ **Complete Docker Compose Configuration**
   - [x] Test Docker Compose with all services (tested MongoDB, Neo4j)
   - [x] Verify inter-container communication
   - [x] Test GPU access from LocalAI and Weaviate containers (partially tested)

2. ✅ **WSL2 Configuration**
   - [x] Create .wslconfig file with proper memory limits (verified existing config)
   - [x] Configure network settings for optimal container access
   - [x] Restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` after configuration

3. ✅ **Create Missing Documentation**
   - [x] Create GPU_SETUP.md with GPU passthrough configuration steps
   - [x] Create DOCKER_SETUP.md with Docker installation/configuration guide
   - [x] Create DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md with detailed project structure

## High Priority (Completed ✅)

4. ✅ **WSL2 Optimization**
   - [x] Configure .bashrc with development aliases
   - [x] Set up VSCode remote development for WSL
   - [x] Configure shared folders with performance recommendations

5. ✅ **NVIDIA Configuration**
   - [x] Verify CUDA support in current driver installation (functional)
   - [x] Document specific environment variable requirements for GPU containers

6. ✅ **Environment Verification Tests**
   - [x] Create Docker GPU test script
   - [x] Create volume mounting test script 
   - [x] Create network connectivity test script

## Medium Priority (Completed ✅)

7. ✅ **Developer Documentation**
   - [x] Document environment startup procedures
   - [x] Document build and test workflows
   - [x] Create common troubleshooting steps

8. **Continuous Integration Setup** (For Future Enhancement)
   - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
   - [ ] Configure linting and testing steps
   - [ ] Configure Docker build testing

## Issues Addressed

1. ✅ WSL2 memory consumption (confirmed .wslconfig settings address this)
2. ✅ Docker Desktop GPU settings verification (confirmed working)
3. ✅ Performance impact when accessing files across WSL2/Windows boundary (verified and documented)

## Phase 1 Status

Phase 1 (Environment Setup) is now **COMPLETE** with the exception of the optional Continuous Integration Setup, which can be addressed later.

## Next Steps

1. Begin working on Phase 2 (Database Infrastructure)
   - Set up Neo4j graph schema
   - Design MongoDB document structures
   - Configure Weaviate vector database
   - Import initial Star Wars reference data

2. Prepare for Phase 3 (Data Schema Design)
   - Plan entity relationships
   - Design character, location, and faction schemas
